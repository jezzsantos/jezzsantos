ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jezzsantos and coding is my professional world. 

I'm not just about the code, even though I'm pretty good with it. Coding is about creating meaningful experiences for other people. 
Which, for some of you, may sound lame, but creating those outcomes is far more difficult than writing just any code with any technology or tool.
