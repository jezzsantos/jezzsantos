ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jezzsantos and software is my professional world. 

I'm not just about the product and code, even though I'm pretty good at those things. Software is about creating meaningful experiences for other people, that makes their lives easier. 
Which, for some of you, may sound lame, but creating those outcomes is far more difficult than writing just any code with any technology or tool.
